                    <p class="txt normal">If you don’t have enough to eat before you exercise, you may not have enough
                        gas in the tank. You might burn fewer calories, too. Have some healthy carbs at least an hour in
                        advance of your workout.

                        Try a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk or some whole wheat toast or a bagel. Skip the
                        cream cheese and butter. Saturated fats take longer to digest and can affect the amount of
                        oxygen your blood delivers to your muscles.</p>

                    <p class="txt normal">Don’t have much time before you head to the gym? Eat an apple or a banana 5 or
                        10 minutes before your workout for some quick, natural energy.
                        Your body easily digests these carbohydrates and turns them into the energy you need for
                        exercise. Also, fruit is packed with helpful nutrients. </p><b></b>

                    <p class="txt normal">When you’re working out later in the day, have a small snack about an hour
                        before you get started. A sports bar that has 200 calories or less is a good option.

                        Look for a bar with low-fiber content, ideally 3 grams or less. Too much fiber before a workout
                        can upset your stomach.

                        On the ingredients list, keep an eye out for sugar alcohols, like sorbitol, xylitol, isomalt,
                        and mannitol. Too much of these ingredients can give you cramps or diarrhea.</p>

                        especially after a workout. Your body uses it to repair muscles, to make blood cells, and for
                        many other purposes. For lunch or dinner, serve a leaner source, like grilled chicken or turkey,
                        instead of something like a cheeseburger. </p><b></b>

                        diet, you can get plenty of protein (and lots of other nutrients, including fiber) from plants.
                        Try pinto, kidney, white, or black beans, split peas, or chickpeas. Soy products, like tofu and
                        tempeh, and nuts also have protein.</p>

                    <p class="txt normal">After a workout, go for these instead of a bottle of juice. A lot of the fiber
                        in whole fruits is lost as they become juice.
                        Blueberries, in particular, have been shown to reduce muscle soreness from strenuous exercise.
                        Cherries are another good option. But any berry will likely help. </p><b></b>

                        calories you’ve burned. An intense, hour-long bike ride could burn 590 calories, but a more
                        leisurely one might only use 290.

                        While you might feel like you’ve earned a cookie, it’s better to snack on fruits and vegetables.
                        After you work out, pair your produce with protein to help you feel more full and replenish
                        muscles. Try vegetables with hummus or fruit with Greek yogurt. </p>

                        with carbs. Revisit your childhood with a sandwich made with 2 slices of bread and 4 tablespoons
                        of peanut butter. Of course, now that you’re an adult, you can substitute almond butter. Or try
                        two or three cooked eggs for protein with a half a bagel. </p><b></b>

                        depends on what you are doing. If your activity is less than 60 minutes, sip small amounts of
                        water often to replace lost fluids. But when your workout is intense and lasts longer than an
                        hour, a sports drink could help your hydration and your performance. Just keep an eye on the
                        calories and sugar, like with any other drink, especially if you want to lose weight. </p>
