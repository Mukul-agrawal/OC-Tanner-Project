                <p class="txt normal">Jogging is a form of sustained running or trotting at a steady and slow pace. It
                    is much slower than running but is faster than walking. The main purpose of jogging is to maintain
                    your tempo without causing much strain to the body. This is less taxing on the body, consumes much
                    lesser energy and thereby, helps to sustain for a longer time. Jogging is best suited for people who
                    do not engage in rigorous fitness regimes. It is widely used by people to warm up and cool down the
                    body during exercise routines or runs. People who prepare for runs and marathons take up jogging to
                    build stamina and prep the body.

                    that you can do almost anywhere. This exercise is part of what's called plyometrics, or jump
                    training. Plyometrics is a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance work. This type of
                    exercise works your heart, lungs, and muscles at the same time.It is a full body workout that can
                    target major muscle groups, strengthen bones, and improve cardiovascular fitness and heart health.

                <p class="txt normal">Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon (or
                    muscle group) is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt elasticity
                    and achieve comfortable muscle tone. The result is a feeling of increased muscle control,
                    flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps and to
                    improve function in daily activities by increasing range of motion.Increasing flexibility through
                    stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness. It is common for athletes to stretch
                    before (for warming up) and after exercise in an attempt to reduce risk of injury and increase
                    performance.</p>
